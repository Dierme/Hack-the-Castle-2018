useful script
lsof -I #used to list info on port listen and all that crap
lsof -i | grep [port]
ps -A | grep [the app that is listening to the port of interest]
kill -9 [ps pid]

All these need super user

#TODO

(message all user) Bot functionality                                    #Gunnar (check) (tested with only one participant)
    - add to web interface and call bot_msg_all_participants(msg)       #Alex
trigger questioneer from gui                                            
    - Bot functionality                                                 #Gunnar (check) (tested with only one participant)
    - Trigger from web interface                                        #Alex
    
    ( I added a call to bot function in flask_app.send_questionnaire(qstnnr_id).
    However, I get "Method Not Allowed" from the web interface when using Action/Send.
    Not sure what is up //Gunnar)

WIT                                                                     #Mohammed

Test several concurrent users - has been taken into account but not tested enough

Setting up server for presentation                                      #Alex

Very important!! With a working WIT, do this:
    -Implement code that is currently outcommented (messenger.py:79 and onward)
    -Remove hardcoded keyword and confidence (messenger.py:91 and onward)
    -(Test DB with more than one Questionnaire and that both can be triggered)

#TODO LATER
Button for clearing bot state (dev purpose)
DB Interface - as it is now, bot code is dependent on DB structure.
    Should instead depend on an interface, that handles DB queries.
