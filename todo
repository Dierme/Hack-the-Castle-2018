#Old TODO
1. Polishing bot profile + welcoming message
2. Bot provides general information about event
3. Provide scheduled messages                       #Gunnar
4. Bot organises a team                             #Gunnar
5. Bot collects feedback                            #Gunnar
6. NLP tasks                                        #Mohammad
7. Backend for the bot                              #Alex
8. Bot DB                                           #Tolga


useful script
lsof -I #used to list info on port listen and all that crap
lsof -i | grep [port]
ps -A | grep [the app that is listening to the port of interest]
kill -9 [ps pid]

All these need super user

#TODO
Save answers to DB                                                      #Gunnar (check)
helper function retrieve questions                                      #Gunnar (check)
replace hardcoded questioneer-id with get-questioneer by keyword        #Gunnar (check)
only trigger questioneer on keyword (currently hardcoded)               #Gunnar (check)
    -This is fixed. However the keyword passed to the bot function is currently hardcoded
Smoother replying (use ... when processing)                             #Gunnar (postphoned)
    -Should be implemented by wrapping bot reply function
Ask user before starting questioneer on organizer trigger               #Gunnar (check)


(message all user)                                                      #Gunnar, Alex
trigger questioneer from gui (link send_questionnaire(qstnnr_id) in flask_app)  #Gunnar

WIT                                                                     #Mohammed

Test several concurrent users - has been taken into account but not tested enough

Setting up server for presentation                                      #Alex

Very important!! With a working WIT, do this:
    -Implement code that is currently outcommented (messenger.py:79 and onward)
    -Remove hardcoded keyword and confidence (messenger.py:91 and onward)
    -(Test DB with more than one Questionnaire and that both can be triggered)

#TODO LATER
Button for clearing bot state (dev purpose)
DB Interface - as it is now, bot code is dependent on DB structure.
    Should instead depend on an interface, that handles DB queries.
